    Metals are elements that start out as rocks (called ores). It takes lots of energy to mine them, grind them, and heat them up (smelting) to get just the part we want. For example, it takes eight tons of the ore bauxite to make one ton of aluminum. While this process is very energy intensive, the good news is… Almost All Metals are Recyclable!
If you have a hard object made out of metal — a can, toy, tool, or car part — you don’t have to worry about what type of metal it is. Just put it in your blue bin. Click the links below for more information about the different metal types.
