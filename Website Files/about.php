          <h4>One Stop Web Portal</h4>
          <p class="text-justify"> Greenify aims to be a one stop web portal for Singapore Residence to get information on how to reduce their waste and how to dispose of their waste properly. It promotes and simplifies the process of 3Rs (Reduce, Recycle & Reuse) to encourage more people to recycle. Greenify allows smart waste categorisation, suggests how he/she can reuse the waste, provides nearby recycle bin locations and navigates users to the nearest one. Lastly, our goal is to expand the number of Singapore Residence who recycle so that the life of Pulau Semakau can be extended and more time is allowed to find improved ways of waste disposal.</p>
